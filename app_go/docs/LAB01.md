# Lab 01

## Framework Selection

Stated in GO.md

Same as in python implemmentation (except PEP8 and I have no dependencies in go implementation)

Same as in Python implementation (except Framework:Go and no python_version but go_version)

## Challenges & Solutions
For first week there were no significant challanges.

## GitHub Community
Starring repositories matters because it supports open-source projects by increasing their visibility and helping maintainers gauge community interest. Following developers helps build professional networks that foster collaboration, learning, and growth opportunities in team projects.
